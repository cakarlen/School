1. Missing parenthesis on the 20th line of "average.py"
2. File "/Users/chasekarlen/Documents/School/Junior, 2nd semester/CS115/.idea/average.py", line 23
   value2 = float(input("Second Number: "))
         ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax
   Process finished with exit code 1
3. I was able to fix the syntax error by going to the line that threw the error
   and added a parenthesis to the very end of the statement
4. There was a semantics error in the program on line 26 when
   calculating the average. When taking an average, one must
   add the numbers and then divide by the same amount of numbers
   that were added together. In the program, it was trying to divide
   one number by two before adding the two numbers together first
   and then dividing that by two.
5. The error was on line 20.
6. I was able to fix the semantics error by putting parenthesis
   around value1 and value2 to first add the two values and then
   dividing by the result of the addition.
