# Prolog with 3 P's
# Import sqrt from math
# Define main()
# Display title and author
# Input the 3 resistances and the power for the circuits in floats
# Print new line
# Calculate the resistance of the two circuits, serial and parallel
# Prevent division by zero by checking the 3 inputs for zero value
    # at least one resistance was zero, make parallel result very large (1e300)
    # If none are zero, resistances are ok
        # Calculate the regular parallel resistance
# Calculate the current of the series and parallel using sqrt function
# Print the resistance of the series and parallel with rounding to 3 decimals
# Print the current of the series and parallel with rounding to 3 decimals
# Call main()
